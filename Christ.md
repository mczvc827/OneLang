> Someone said to one of the members of **Church of Christ**
"He is good."

But then he said in accordance:
"But, God is good and gracious and good-hearted."

## Ps. 118:1, NIV —
> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever.

And so we decided to share our Faith: we, as members of the **Church Of Christ** (**Iglesia Ni Cristo**), are now inviting you, to attend our `Evangelical Missions`, to hear and know the `True Faith`, the `Words of our Almighty God`, as we are extending you the `True Faith` of our **Lord Jesus Christ**; to have the same Faith as, of our **Savior**, **Jesus Christ**, and share the same `Christlikeness` of the `true Christians`; to know the truth about the `One True Church` that **Jesus Christ** had established from the beginning of the century, which was our `redemption in this Christian Era`.

Know the truth and be saved, for we truly believed that the time has already come for us to be saved.

We are forever thankful to the **Lord**, for **His faithful love to His people**; forever and ever we will always be faithful to `His will`.

## Ephesians 1, NIV
#### Praise for Spiritual Blessings in Christ

**(Ephesians 1:3-10)**
```
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will— to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. 

In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that he lavished on us.

With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
```

## Addendum —
to what we had received contextual praises in the beginning, let me share some wisdom that had lit upon after some realizations:

> "Angels, and human souls, created in the image of God, are intellect and will."

> Angels are synonymous with /messengers/ in NIV of Revelation 1:20 (footnote [e]). While human souls is guided by the Spirit, or the will of the God. In Jesus' letter to John the Baptist, it is written in NIV of Revelation 1:4, Spirits or the /Seven Spirits/, footnote [a], that is, the "sevenfold Spirit", Jesus wishes Grace and Peace to John, and to the Seven Churches in the province of Asia, Whom it was from Him— Who is, and Who was, and Who is to come; and from the Revelation (of and from) Jesus Christ, "which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place; He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."

```
Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near. 
``` 
> **[Revelation 1:3]**

> "`God` loves us truly; and, `He` always think of **His begotten Son**, **Jesus Christ**, that He created, and delivered us, to be freed from our sins *by His blood* through **His Son**, `"and has made us to be a kingdom, to serve his God and Father"—to have the same Faith as our Lord, to worship and praise our Almighty Father; To Him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen."` **[Revelation 1:5-6, NIV]**

> **{ John 17:[20-23], NIV }**

#### Jesus Prays for All Believers
```
“My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
```

    - > And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.

- [New Living Translation]
    - > Now, Father, bring me into the glory we shared before the world began.

And so, we are truly innate—yet, needs the True Salvation to glorify, praise, and honor, the Father, and His Son by the Holy Spirit—and are only part of His image; while God is Sole and Whole Being—a Living God. — **יְשַׁעְיָהוּ** *lit.* **(God is Salvation)**

In an honor to **Almighty Father**, We must glorify and praise **His** name, by the **Holy Spirit**, *through* **our Lord Jesus Christ**: glory and praises unto **Almighty God**!

**[1 Timothy 1:17, New Living Translation]**
> All honor and glory to **God** forever and ever! He is the **eternal King**, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is **God**. Amen.

So let me also share some important notes from the passages, facts from the `Holy Bible`, and guide you, in an instant, to the reason why i am **confidently believing** that there is real explanation that there is real science behind the Faith that i have received; or it was already established as `Christian Science` [or CS, *really*] to begin with.

## Christian Science

According to Wikipedia: "**Mary Baker Eddy** (born **Mary Morse Baker** July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) was the founder of the `Christian Science` movement. Deeply religious, she advocated `Christian Science` as a spiritual practical solution to health and moral issues. She wrote Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, founded `The First Church of Christ, Scientist` of Boston in 1879, and several periodicals including `The Christian Science Monitor`. She took the name **Mary Baker Glover** from her first marriage and was also known as **Mary Baker Glover Eddy** *or* **Mary Baker G. Eddy** from her third marriage. She did much spiritual teaching, lecturing, and instantaneous healing. Her influence continues to grow through her writings."

`Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures` is the central text of the `Christian Science` religion. It was written by **Mary Baker Eddy**, inspired by studies of the `Bible` she undertook in 1867 following a healing experience. `Science and Health` posits a wholly metaphysical view of **Christianity** in which *sin, disease, and death* *are not of **God***, and are therefore *not real*. Further, it suggests that by striving toward a spiritual understanding of the world as **God's perfect creation**, these *"false beliefs"* are shed from one's experience.

I then asked, by a Member of the `Roman Catholic`, where i am in a Country where the majority of people are indeed a major (`Roman Catholic`)s, by the question "why is it that the **Church Of Christ** don't really believe that **Christ** *is also a God* [in nature], [and why is that that there is *no Christmas* in the **Church Of Christ**, when it is really that they were a *true Christians*]?

Let me answer first shortly the question, reframing, is *Christmas really a true Christian belief*? Short answer is **No**, it was really a **pagan belief**, (**1 Corinthians 10:[20, 21-22], Warning Against Idolatry, ESV, NET**). 
That is why there is no reason to have that celebration, in customary, in the True Church, even if it will be celebrated in *"a Christian way"*, for example that there will be a **Thanksgiving to the Lord**.

And let me go head-on to ask, is `Roman Catholic` a *true Christian church* [or perhaps, is it really in accordance to the real *Christianism*]? As some will say `it is`, by definition, *a Christian Church*. As it was really **established**, in our case in the Philippines, **three centuries then**.

Let us also answer the question: why was it that the **Church Of Christ** is really the **One True Church**, the **Christ's Church**, and why it is the only true salvation we need. The **Bible** will answer these questions conclusively, while we will trace back our first question, is `Roman Catholic` *a true Christian Church*? (Back then it was considered heretical to question the *Church*, or the `Roman Catholic`, and it was really a `state church` to considered as *"true and pure,"* and any opposition would result to blaspheming against the *Church*)

Let me first utter a simple prayer, *not in a Psalmic way*, but a **simple**, **revelatory**, in acceptance, that i am also flawed, and in a `No Way a Roman Catholic`, or a *paradoxically dogmatic*.

**(Psalm 145:18-20, New International Version)**
> The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them. The LORD watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.

**(Ephesians 4:27, New English Translation)**
> Do not give the devil an opportunity.

```
Because we are imperfect, O Jehovah,
The inclination of our heart is flawed.

There is a sin that easily ensnares us—
A lack of faith in you, the living God.

We disobey, we offend, we betray the One who created us.
```

> “Love the sinner; hate the sin.”
**(Ephesians 4:32, NET)**

```
Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.
```

>* **(Psalms 18:[20-22], New International Version)**
```
The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;
    according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
For I have kept the ways of the Lord;
    I am not guilty of turning from my God.

    I have not turned away from his decrees.

```

> **[Matthew 18:1-5, Good News Translation]**
#### Who Is the Greatest?

```
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, asking, “Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?”

So Jesus called a child to come and stand in front of them, and said, “I assure you that unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the Kingdom of heaven. The greatest in the Kingdom of heaven is the one who humbles himself and becomes like this child. And whoever welcomes in my name one such child as this, welcomes me.
```

> **{ Ephesians 4:[17-19, 22-24], New Living Translation }**
#### Living as Children of Light

```
With the Lord’s authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly confused. Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him. They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.

... throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy.
```

> **{Ephesians 5:[1-2], NIV}**
```
Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
```

> **[Colossians 3:1-4, New Living Translation]**
#### Living the New Life

```
Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God’s right hand. Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.  For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God.  And when Christ, who is your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.
```

**Romans 12:9** — Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.

**Corinthians 16:14** — Do everything in love.

**Colossians 3:14** — And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.

**Ephesians 4:2** — Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.

**1 Peter 4:8** — Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other, for love covers a multitude of sins.

**1 John 4:12**: No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.

**1 John 4:16**: And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.

```
And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can’t. I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. . . . Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God’s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.

The Lord's Plan for His People

The holy God of Israel,
the Lord who saves you, says:
“I am the Lord your God,
the one who wants to teach you for your own good
and direct you in the way you should go.

“If only you had listened to my commands!
Then blessings would have flowed for you
like a stream that never goes dry.
Victory would have come to you
like the waves that roll on the shore.

Your descendants would be as numerous as grains of sand,
and I would have made sure they were never destroyed.”
...
“There is no safety for sinners,” says the Lord.
```

> **[New International Version]**
```
This is what the Lord says—
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
“I am the Lord your God,
who teaches you what is best for you,
who directs you in the way you should go.

If only you had paid attention to my commands,
your peace would have been like a river,
your well-being like the waves of the sea.

Your descendants would have been like the sand,
your children like its numberless grains;
their name would never be blotted out
nor destroyed from before me.”
...
“There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”

```
Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.

For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
```

{
Note 1 on blood and water in John 19:34 in the New Testament Recovery Version is tremendously helpful. Let’s look at some portions of this lengthy note. The first section says:

“Two substances came out of the Lord’s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death (12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30). The Lord’s death, on the negative side, takes away our sins, and on the positive side, imparts life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the other three Gospels portrays only the redemptive aspect of the Lord’s death. John’s record portrays not only the redemptive aspect but also the life-imparting aspect.”

https://blog.biblesforamerica.org/what-does-the-blood-and-water-that-came-out-of-jesus-pierced-side-mean/
https://blog.biblesforamerica.org/knowing-gods-cleansing/

Again, David pleads for cleansing. He asks the Lord to purge him with hyssop to make him clean and to wash him to make him whiter than snow. To purge meant to purify by removing a stain. Hyssop was a plant that the priests used in ceremonial cleansings. They dipped a bunch of hyssop in the blood of a sacrificial animal and then sprinkled the blood on the person who required cleansing. Leviticus 14:4–7 refers to the use of blood-dipped hyssop in sprinkling seven times the person who is to be cleansed of leprosy.

David recognized that he would be whiter than snow if the Lord washed away his sin. In Isaiah 1:18 the Lord invited the sinful people of Judah to come to Him and reason with Him, promising, "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool." When Jesus washed His disciples' feet in the upper room, He told unwilling Peter he would have no share with Him unless He washed them (John 13:8). 

#### Context Summary
Psalm 51:1–7 is David's plea for mercy and cleansing. He admits he has sinned against God. His approach to confession is to take God's attitude toward sin. He sees his sins as transgressions, iniquity, evil, and the result of his lifelong offensive nature. First John 1:9–10 corresponds to this passage by teaching believers to confess their sins—to agree with God's stance about those sins—with the promise of God's forgiveness and cleansing.

#### Chapter Summary
This psalm opens with David's plea to God to show him mercy. He asks God to blot out his transgressions, wash his iniquities, and cleanse him from sin. He admits his sinning was against God. He also confesses his human sin nature. David asks God to make him as white as snow by purging him with hyssop. He longs for joy to return to him, but knows he was suffering because God had turned away from him. He pleads with God for a clean heart and a right spirit. He does not want God to cast him aside and remove His Holy Spirit. David longs for a renewal of the joy of his salvation. If cleansing from sin occurred and joy returned to him, David would teach transgressors God's ways, and sinners would be converted. He promises near the end of the psalm to declare God's praise if God would forgive him. He knew it would be futile to offer a sacrifice to God, because God delights in a broken and contrite heart and not in sacrifices offered with an unrepentant heart. David closes the psalm with a prayer for God to bless Jerusalem.

**[John 13:8, New Living Translation]**
No,' Peter protested, 'you will never ever wash my feet!' Jesus replied, 'Unless I wash you, you won’t belong to me.'
What does [John 13:8] mean?

Peter objects to Jesus performing the submissive task of a servant: washing of others' feet (John 13:6). His motivation is noble, since he clearly sees Jesus as his master. In the prior verse, Jesus reassured the disciples that they would better understand this action later (John 13:7).

Peter, never quick to take a hint, responds with a strongly-phrased expression in Greek. His exact words are "ou mē…eis ton aiōna!" This is somewhat like saying "no way…not ever!" in English. This is sincere, but stubborn. Peter does not understand, but suggests he doesn't need to: he cannot imagine Jesus acting like a servant. If he can't understand it, he won't cooperate with it.

Jesus' response is equally black-and-white. His wording is an ultimatum: either I do this, or you have nothing to do with me. In the most immediate sense, this is a rebuke of Peter's stubbornness. So far as the literal, physical foot-washing between Jesus and Peter is concerned, it's a non-negotiable. One can imagine Jesus saying something to the effect of "I'm not asking you Peter, I'm telling you."

Scholars differ in how—or if—to apply Jesus' comment to believers in general. On one hand, there's a universal sense in which those who abjectly refuse to submit to Christ are, by definition, not His followers. If someone follows through on an attitude of "I am not doing that, Jesus" then they have "no part" in Him or His kingdom. On the other hand, this comment can't be separated from the literal context or the statements Jesus is about to make.

As the passage continues, Jesus will distinguish between "washing" and "bathing." This will include an allusion to Judas' betrayal. That background makes an application of Jesus' words to the modern believer more specific: this speaks about fellowship, not eternal salvation. 

#### Context Summary
John 13:1–11 begins the ''private'' phase of John's gospel, as Jesus meets with the disciples for a Passover meal. As usual, John skips details covered in other Gospels in order to add his own memories. Jesus performs the task of a lowly servant: washing others' feet. Jesus reassures everyone that this task will make more sense later. Peter is offended by his master acting like a slave, but Jesus responds that washing is necessary for those who follow Him—and not all of those present are clean. That subtly points to Judas, who has already made plans to betray Jesus. A ''full-body'' washing only needs to happen once, while ''foot washing'' needs to be done more frequently. This helps explain the difference between once-for-all salvation, and routine confession of sin.

#### Chapter Summary
Jesus meets with a smaller group, possibly only the twelve disciples, in a private setting. Before eating a meal, Jesus performs the work of a lowly servant, washing the feet of the disciples. He explains that this is an object lesson. Their Lord is willing to serve in humility, so they are obligated to do the same. Jesus also predicts His impending betrayal, subtly telling Judas to leave and complete His conspiracy. The disciples don't realize what's happened, however. Peter foolishly brags about his loyalty. Jesus responds with a cutting prediction: Peter will deny his relationship to Christ three times in the next few hours.

```
No,' Peter protested, 'you will never ever wash my feet!' Jesus replied, 'Unless I wash you, you won’t belong to me.'

Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism.

#### Place Your Life Before God

```
(12:1-2) So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: 
Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering. 

Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don’t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You’ll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. 

Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.
```

Don’t become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants—what is good, pleasing, and perfect.

#### Jesus the Real Vine

```
“I am the real vine, and my Father is the gardener. He breaks off every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and he prunes every branch that does bear fruit, so that it will be clean and bear more fruit. You have been made clean already by the teaching I have given you. Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself; it can do so only if it remains in the vine. In the same way you cannot bear fruit unless you remain in me.

...

My Father's glory is shown by your bearing much fruit; and in this way you become my disciples.

I'll go on with one asking.

So, let me first asked, is one of the fundamental belief of `Roman Catholic`, `Trinitism`, or the `Holy Trinity of the Church`, can be in accordance with the teachings of our **Lord Jesus Christ**, or is it really Biblical, true and simple, as it may have called fundamental teachings of the `Roman Catholic Church`?

(where it is defined, as by `Merriam`'s: `the unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to [Roman Catholic, or the Church] dogma`).

Then it has to be, that, it is wrongly attributed, as they were also believing that **Christ** was *"a God"* in nature, and that: was purely wrong, and it was a tainted, and really a sin to Almighty God; as it was also wrong that there were actually two remaining more, as *God the Father* is the other one, immanent in "one Godhead", or perhaps there were actually 3 personas they were implying, intrinsically united, being in a person with our only **Christ**, which was also being **Jesus**, as he is the only **Christ-Jesus**, or **Lord Jesus Christ** ~ when he is actually, really a man of nature, a *Son of God*, not unified 3 persons to a one, **not God**, [nor there is 3 persons, nor clearly there were more gods other than the *Father*, and that are also all a God in nature], which was clearly a valid violation to the definition of what the `Catholics` believed `Trinity`; as it was written in the `Holy Bible` that there was only one *God*, and a **Son** (not Sons). **(Ephesians 4:[4-6], NET)**

> **[Deuteronomy 11:16]**
```
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them. 
```

> **Translation**

```
. . . be careful. Don’t let anyone tempt you to do something wrong. Don’t turn away and worship other gods. Don’t bow down to them.
```

> **—New International Reader’s Version**

It was also an error to have a *son*, which was deemed to be also *"a God"*, to a one **True God**, a misnomer and an impossible recursion by definition to have only one **God**, but has a *Son* who is also a **God** by nature, of which it can be corrected by what was written in the Bible [that there is no other **God** other than the **True Almighty God**].

This is repeated in numerous other places: **(Deut. 4:35, NIV; Isa. 44:6, KJV, ISV; John 14:28, NIV; 1 Cor. 8:4, NIV; 1 Tim. 1:17, NIV)**

In the Bible, the greatest teaching is expressed in the Shema:

> ✡️ שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד

> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.

```
"Let there be no doubt that the Bible is stridently monotheistic; no ifs, no buts about it."
```

This one **God** is the **[One True] **God**** we must know to the extent that we can know **Him**. In the `Old Testament`, **God** is referred to, as only one **True God**, in many passages, such as:

** Deutronomy 5:7 **

* **Zech. 2:6-12** – the LORD (= YHWH) claims three times that He has been sent by the LORD.

* **Isa. 48:11-16, NIV** – again, the LORD has been sent by the Sovereign LORD.

* **Isa. 63:7-10, NIV**, **"Praise and Prayer"** – the LORD (described as a Father) sends His divine servant (the angel of His presence) and His Holy Spirit who is grieved (compare Ps. 78:40, NIV).

* **Ex. 23:20, NIV** – the angel of the LORD’s
was sent ahead. And it was expressed in different passage in ^(1 John 5:7, NKJV) of what was the purpose of the angel's presence.

* **Hos. 1:7, NIV** – the **LORD** – their **God** – shows love to Judah, and saves them — not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen.

* **Prov. 30:1-4, NIV** – [The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance] – says in an inspired utterance that the Son of God is as unfathomable as God Himself. As implied by asking His name in **30:4**: `"What is his name, and what is the name of his son?
    Surely you know!"`

> **[Matthew 11:25-27, Good News Translation]**
```
...
“My Father has given me all things. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
```

>>** Only `the Father`, `the God`, and **His Son**, Only, indeed, **Christ-Jesus**.

And, as a **Christian**, I am in no way devotee of extreme ideologies, [e.g. humanism (Isaiah 2:22; Matt. 10:17, NET), scientism, -isms, nor etc. and of *politik*], but redeemed and saved by the grace and mercy of `Almighty God` through **Christ**, **Jesus**, still has a Hope for our Brothers and Sisters in the faith and prays for the safety of their lives, everyday of my life. And like **Jesus**, as a servant of His will, i have to expend great amount of time and energy, on devout prayers, on how **He** choose and accept **His** Fate, before **His** deliverance, upon entering the valley of Mount of `Olive`, to lit **His** feet on a straight path, to call for `God`, and ask for `His guidance`, once more, for these arduous times, like **His Faith**, to overcome what was the Great Trials of Our Times.

And so, **volunteering in humanitarian cause** is **essential** nowadays, as it was primary to the **God's plan**, for **salvation**. Like what was written on the **Bible**:

> **Hebrews 13:16**: “And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.”

> **Hebrews 6:10**: “God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.”

> **James 1:17, GNT**: “Every good gift and every perfect present comes from heaven; it comes down from God, the Creator of the heavenly lights, who does not change or cause darkness by turning.”

```
In Nihilistic's point of view (not nihilistic per se, but logical):
Satan is corruption.

Every corruption is Satan's way.
Yet, do not accept the fate, the fact, that you are corrupted. You are already (you have been), but do not accept that it is always.

There is satan's corruption(s), and there are humans' corruption. But do not focus on the both. There is no Greater Evil, but Satan's Corruption (it is not the Absolute). 

“We Are Already Prepared from the Worst.”
It will all soon be over. (Revelation 22:13, ESV; Isaiah 2:18, NET)

The next time is Now, ever.

Accept, instead, then, the God's Way.
Do not forget, but this is emancipation: God is Salvation.

Satan is the obstruction to the God's Way.

Everywhere, God's Will, and yet, sadly, there are the Satan's way, and so, there are corruptions happening.

Therefore, absolutism is also an Evil's way. [Every -ism(s) is already corrupted in every way]

But do not fret, nor be sad, nor be fixated to the world's busy-ness. Do not be coward (John 20:26, HCSB), but be courageous, fighting our way by the God's Way with the Goodwill of His (John 20:[29, 28], HCSB). We have His Every Guidance, a shield that is True, Godly, and, Purely. We are on the March of Victory, to Every Salvation. He (the Father: the God) is Always, Absolutely Pure, Verily, i say.

And so, as we echo to you what was the Greatest Protection, that we have received through Salvation: be prayerful; God is Compassionate and Merciful. He is All, the Love, we ever need.

Fight for the Faith He has Given, by His Holy Spirit, through Lord Jesus Christ.

You are Good in every way.

This is, the Last Days—the day has come for the True Salvation.

“Through it all, we can always lean on our Almighty God.”

This is our Faith. Father in You we have come.
```

> Like **Christ**, I want to acknowledge **His** — **the Almighty Father’s—servants**, and of **His Great People**, especially **His Church**’s people, who are now sharing the **Same Faith of His Messenger**[s].

>- **{ 1 John 4[:17], Psalm 34:[17-19] }**

>- **Psalm 145:18-20, New International Version**
```
The Lord is near to all who call on him,
    to all who call on him in truth.
He fulfills the desires of those who fear him;
    he hears their cry and saves them.
The Lord watches over all who love him,
    but all the wicked he will destroy.

The **Bible** also clearly explained the **Holy Spirit**, **The Son**, and **The God**, as being referred to, are found written in different passages.

**(Psalm 118:22, KJV)**
```
The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
```

**Ephesians 1:22, NIV** —
```
And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be /head/ over everything for the church.
```

> * **Acts 20:28, GLT** – Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, to feed the Church of Christ which he has purchased with his blood.

Which what was being referred **Holy Spirit** is **Christ**'s.

```
[What is this Church? It is the great company of the redeemed, all those who are truly saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the sum total of all those who are born again, who are genuine Christians.]

The Church is the body of Christ, and Christ is the Saviour of the body; then all who are saved are in that body, and outside that body there is no salvation.
```
> A Time To Unite, pp. 29-31<br>
David Middleton

The phrase *“the Body of Christ”* is a common **New Testament** metaphor for the *Church* **(all those who are truly saved)**. The `Church` is called `“one body in Christ”` in **Romans 12:5**, `“one body”` in **1 Corinthians 10:17**, `“the body of Christ”` in **1 Corinthians 12:27** and **Ephesians 4:12**, and **“the body”** in **Hebrews 13:3**. The `Church` is clearly equated with `“the body”` of **Christ** in **Ephesians 5:23** and **Colossians 1:24**.

No, I will not abandon you as orphans—I will come to you.

Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live. When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.

That day will be a day of wrath—

    a day of darkness and gloom,
        a day of clouds and blackness—
     a day of trumpet and battle cry
against the fortified cities
    and against the corner towers.

 “I will bring such distress on all people
    that they will grope about like those who are blind,
    because they have sinned against the Lord.
Their blood will be poured out like dust
    and their entrails like dung.
 Neither their silver nor their gold
    will be able to save them
    on the day of the Lord’s wrath.”

In the fire of his jealousy
    the whole earth will be consumed,
for he will make a sudden end
    of all who live on the earth.

```
 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—

For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!

## THUS

The trinity is never mentioned in the bible and Jesus never mentions he is God. 

Nothing in the bible can justify the trinity. Even the only verse ^(1 John 5:7) [that mentions 3, was removed from the RSV and NIV as a fabrication.]

# IN CONCLUSION

There is no other God, but the one true God.

The Trinity is a whole made up fabrications of ✝️ Catholics, which was their fundamental belief in their faith.

No evidence in the Bible that there is Trinity, and that one true God "consists" of three persons.

```
Though the exact terms in which the [Catholic] Church has formally defined the dogma of the Blessed Trinity ... are not in the Bible, and may, therefore, in a sense be called unscriptural;

```
Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other.
```

Who was **Apollos**? According to the `book of Acts`, **Apollos** was an influential teacher and leader who advanced the gospel of **Jesus** in the early **Christian church**. The `writer of Acts`, **Luke**, describes him as a `Jew`, native to `Alexandria, Egypt`, who journeyed to `Ephesus` for unclear reasons **(Acts 18:24-28)**. He was an evangelist, apologist, church leader, and friend of the apostle Paul. He was described as **“eloquent,”** **“mighty in the Scriptures,”** **“fervent in the spirit”** and **“instructed in the way of the Lord”**.

> * **Apoc. (Rev.) 22:[18-19], NIV**
```
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.
```

In summary, Apollos was a man of letters with a zeal for the Lord and a talent for preaching. He labored in the Lord’s work, aiding the ministry of the apostles and faithfully building up the church. His life should encourage each of us to “grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord” **(2 Peter 3:18)** and to use our God-given gifts to promote truth.

One way we grow under the grace of `God` is to grow in our knowledge of Christ. This implies two ideas. One of these is knowing more and more about Christ in our minds: information. The other is getting to know Jesus better and better in our relationship with Him. Both contribute to making us more productive servants **(1 Peter 1:8)**.

#### What does 1 Peter 1:8 mean?
**Christianity**—our faith in **Christ**; as in **verse 6**, Peter assumes that faith and love this concrete, this real, results in real rejoicing. Saving faith in Christ brings with it a joy which can't be expressed. Words can't contain it. It's a joy full of glory, reflecting our future with **Christ** in the moment in front of us. Again we see that the choice to rejoice, even the middle of our trials, is an act of faith. It doesn't require soaring emotions, but it certainly can contribute to them. Joy flows from our growing confidence in the **Christ** we love. 

> **(1 Peter 1:6)**
```
In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
```

#### What does **2 Peter 3:18 mean**?
**Verses 17 and 18** are the conclusion of `Peter's letter` and should be taken **together**. These words summarize `Peter's letter`, and include both a *warning against being misled by the false teachers* and **an encouragement to keep growing** in **Christ**. Specifically, `Peter` *urges* his readers to `grow in two areas`: The **grace of Jesus**, and their **knowledge of Him**.

To grow in grace *does not mean* to get more and more of `God's grace`, necessarily. **Grace**, by definition, is unearned, unworked for. By **His grace**, `God has forgiven our sins and given us full rights as His children` *in* **Christ**. We can't get more of that. But living under the grace of **Jesus** provides us a **huge opportunity to grow spiritually stronger and deeper**. `Peter` wrote in `chapter 1` that *we are not missing anything we need* to **lead the life** `God calls us` to. **Now it's time to do it**.

`One way we grow` under the **grace of God** is to `grow in our knowledge` of **Christ**. This implies two ideas. **One** of these is knowing more and more about **Christ** in our minds: information. The other is getting to know **Jesus** better and better in our relationship with **Him**. Both contribute to making us more productive servants **(1 Peter 1:8)**.

`Peter` describes **Jesus** as both our **Lord** and **our Savior**. To *really know* **Him**, `we must continue to grow in our understanding of what it means to live in relationship` to **Jesus as Lord** and as **Savior**.

And you know the way to where I am going.”

“No, we don’t know, Lord,” Thomas said. “We have no idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
